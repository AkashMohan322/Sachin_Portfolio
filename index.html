    <p>Sachin Tendulkar, in full Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India), Indian professional cricket player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In 2012 he became the first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in international play. <br>Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score 329 out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. A year later he scored a century on his first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205 days he became India’s youngest Test (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989. When he was 18 he scored two centuries in Australia (148 in Sydney and 114 in Perth), and in 1994 he scored 179 against the West Indies. In August 1996, at age 23, Tendulkar was made captain of his country’s team.<br>In 2012 Tendulkar became a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Indian parliament—the first active athlete to join that body; he was nominated to the post, and his term ended in 2018. In 2014 he became the first sportsman to receive India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. Tendulkar was inducted into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame in 2019. <br>In an ODI match against Bangladesh in March 2012, Tendulkar scored his record-setting 100th international century—which included both Test (51 centuries) and ODI (49 centuries) play. He retired from ODI cricket later that year, and in 2013 he ended a six-year stint with the Indian Premier League (as a member of the Mumbai Indians) and retired from Test cricket, ending his playing days with records for the most career international runs (34,357) and Test runs (15,921).</p>

                <p>Sport does not differentiate once we enter the arena. It's a level-playing field that allows everyone to flourish and prepares the individuals for various life skills. Sports as a leveller teaches us how to deal with success and failure. </p>

                    <h1>'Sachin: Cricketer of the Century' by Vimal Kumar</h1>
                    <p>The book includes accounts from bigwigs in the
                        cricketing field and covers each of Tendulkar's
                        matches and his batting career, which has seen its ups
                        and downs. It shows you that his wins outweigh his
                        losses substantially and that's what makes him the
                        greatest cricketer in the history of the game.

                        <p>There aren't many books out there that look at Sachin
                            in an overtly critical fashion because his achievements
                            are widely acclaimed by numerous fans. This book
                            seeks to overcome such a social stigma and look at
                            Sachin Tendulkar's career in an objective manner.

                                wonderful moments in the form of this book. Each
                                match Sachin played was special and each century he
                                made was even more special for his fans</p>

                                <p>At the young age of 17, Tendulkar earned the title of
                                    being the second-youngest man to score a hundred
